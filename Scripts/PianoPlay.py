# Some notes I want to make about the system I'm using.
# Right now, because I hand make the animations, they won't really work in any setting besides the one that I've defined.
# I'm current animating the keys by simply rotating towards a (Euler X) angle.
# I think this will cause problems at different orientations, and I should look in to vector based animation if that's a thing in Blender.


# To do next time:
# Definitely change how I'm finding the relative file path. It will not work if literally anything is renamed. Maybe I'll just settle for making the user input the whole path.
# Update comments about usage.
# Add in <division> type 1 code.
