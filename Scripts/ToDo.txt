3D side:
    > I want to model a full piano and environment to use alongside the tone of the song.
    > Create an environment to showcase the technology. I plan on buying real textures for this (A first for me :D).
    > More a blender UI thing, I want to find a way to work with blender's add-on API so that people don't need raw files for this.
    > Add some variation to how long a key is pressed for randomly, especially on arpeggios
    > Add in sustain pedal animation
	
Code:
	> Add pressure sensitivity back in.
    > Procedurally create materials for every key to allow colour animation
    > Allow users to create an animation action, and use that on the keys.
    > Support for instruments other pianos might be a long way off, but if people request it I'll look into it.
    > Allow keys to light up in colour when pressed.
    > Support for other formats? I don't know any others right now, but maybe I could make a custom one in the future?
    > Maybe start using dictionaries when searching for things such as metaevent tags.
    > Add multi track support, so a user can specify two pianos or instruments or whatever.
    > Test whether doing two passes on the midi file to figure out list size will be faster than appending the data to the lists.
    > Remake code to be less... bad. First Python project so it's pretty disorganized.
    > Rotate keys based on local "down", rather than my current system (Euler X regardless of position or orientation.)
    > Change how I'm getting the relative path right now.
    > Add in support for <division> type 1 MIDI files.
    
Other:
    > I'd like to add in some basic soundfont stuff that can play alongside the animation.
    I've never touched audio in blender or soundfonts however, so this might be over my head.
