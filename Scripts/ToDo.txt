3D side:
    >Need to fully model an upright piano (Grand is a bit much and can't really be put into different scenes well).
    >Create an environment to showcase the technology. I plan on buying real textures for this (A first for me :D).
    >More a blender UI thing, I want to find a way to work with blender's add-on API so that people don't need raw files for this.
    >Add some variation to how long a key is pressed completely randomly, especially on arpeggios
    
    
Code and 3D:
    >I want to find a way to light up the keys that get played, in a similar style to Synthesia (But better :) ).
    >Find some way to allow "actions" to be used instead of predefined animation code I've made.
    Doing so will open up the ability to do more instruments and make people do a happy smile face.
    
    
Code:
    > Procedurally create materials for every key.
    > Allow users to create an animation action, and use that on the keys.
    > Support for instruments other pianos might be a long way off, but if people request it I'll look into it.
    > Allow keys to light up in colour when pressed.
    > Support for other formats? I don't know any others right now, but maybe I could make a custom one in the future?
    > Maybe start using dictionaries when searching for things such as metaevent tags.
    > Add multi track support, so a user can specify two pianos or instruments or whatever.
    > Test whether doing two passes on the midi file to figure out list size will be faster than appending the data to the lists.
    > Remake code to be less... bad. First Python project so it's pretty disorganized.
    > Rotate keys based on Z axis down, rather than my current system (Euler X)
    
    
Other:
    >I'd like to add in some basic soundfont stuff that can play alongside the animation.
    I've never touched audio in blender or soundfonts however, so this might be over my head.
